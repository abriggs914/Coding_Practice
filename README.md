# Coding_Practice


A repository containing a nearly all of my side-projects, resources and examples through my time learning to code.
This repo organized by language, then by project.

My coding journey has brought me accross several languages:

	Starting with Java, SQL, and C in my first year of CS.
	These language folders highlight my early career, learning program file structures, data structures, low-level programming, and database paradigms.
	Gradually scaling up to JavaFX front-end applications, and Android mobile application development.
	
	I then moved onto HTML, JavaScript, and python.
	First learning about these in school, I challenged myself with lessons from CodeCademy to further my web-dev knowledge.
	I pushed myself to learn to use new libraries and build my own portable functions and files.
	
	I then learned Access, teaching myself VBA from existing production databases and online resources.
	Using my knowledge of other languages and programming methodologies, I created robust utility files to aid me and others in VBA projects.
	
	Most of my side-projects are now built using either a customtkiner or streamlit UI.
	These environments allow mt to take advantage of utility files to build demos quickly.

	Coding_Practice/Job Hunting
		Contains a word doc of screenshots of functional projects from a real production environment.
		These screenshots highlight Access and streamlit projects in a production plant.
		They showcase modern UIs, intuitive widgets, and advanced data analysis applied to real-world data.
		These projects demonstrate in-depth understanding of data-processing, manipulation, and control logic.
