#DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS

#You’re the lead data analyst for a chain of gardening stores called Petal Power. Help them analyze their inventory!

#import codecademylib

#Data for all of the locations of Petal Power is in the file inventory.csv. Load the data into a DataFrame called inventory.
import pandas as pd

inventory = pd.read_csv('inventory.csv')

#Inspect the first 10 rows of inventory.
#The first 10 rows represent data from your Staten Island location. Select these rows and save them to staten_island.
staten_island = inventory.head(10)
print(staten_island)

#A customer just emailed you asking what products are sold at your Staten Island location. Select the column product_description from staten_island and save it to the variable product_request.
product_request = staten_island.product_description

#Another customer emails to ask what types of seeds are sold at the Brooklyn location.
#Select all rows where location is equal to Brooklyn and product_type is equal to seeds and save them to the variable seed_request.
seed_request = inventory[(inventory.location == 'Brooklyn') & (inventory.product_type == 'seeds')]

#Add a column to inventory called in_stock which is True if quantity is greater than 0 and False if quantity equals 0.
inventory['in_stock'] = inventory.quantity.apply(lambda x: True if x > 0 else False)

#Petal Power wants to know how valuable their current inventory is.
#Create a column called total_value that is equal to price multiplied by quantity.
inventory['total_value'] = inventory.apply(lambda x: x.price*x.quantity, axis = 1)

#The Marketing department wants a complete description of each product for their catalog.
#The following lambda function combines product_type and product_description into a single string:
#combine_lambda = lambda row: \
#   '{} - {}'.format(row.product_type,
#                     row.product_description)
#Paste this function into script.py.

combine_lambda = lambda row: \
    '{} - {}'.format(row.product_type,
                     row.product_description)

#Using combine_lambda, create a new column in inventory called full_description that has the complete description of each product.
inventory['full_description'] = inventory.apply(combine_lambda, axis = 1)

print(inventory)
